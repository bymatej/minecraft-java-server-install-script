Ensure you have a working internet connection.

Update your system.
sudo apt --assume-yes update

Install Java 8 and screen (if you want to run commands with screen).
sudo apt --assume-yes install openjdk-8-jre-headless screen

Add user for minecraft.
sudo adduser <MINECRAFT_USERNAME>
The <MINECRAFT_USERNAME> represents the usernem for the user that will be used for installing the game-related files. If the username is minecraft, then the command is:
sudo adduser minecraft
When prompted for password enter it (and retype when prompted). Fill out the rest of the information.
For the rest of the tutorial, I will refer to the minecraft user as <MINECRAFT_USERNAME>. Replace it with the username you just created.

Execute the following commands as sudo. This downloads the etc.zip (mono - required for McMyAdmin) and sets iptables (required for connections on certain ports to work properly).
cd /usr/local
sudo wget http://mcmyadmin.com/Downloads/etc.zip
sudo unzip etc.zip
sudo rm etc.zip
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 8080 -j ACCEPT 
sudo iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m tcp --dport 25565 -j ACCEPT 
sudo iptables-save

Log in as newly created user: 
su <MINECRAFT_USERNAME>
If the username is minecraft, then the command is:
su minecraft
cd /home/<MINECRAFT_USERNAME>
mkdir minecraft-server
cd minecraft-server
mkdir /home/<MINECRAFT_USERNAME>/minecraft-server/McMyAdmin
cd /home/<MINECRAFT_USERNAME>/minecraft-server/McMyAdmin
wget http://mcmyadmin.com/Downloads/MCMA2_glibc26_2.zip
unzip MCMA2_glibc26_2.zip
rm MCMA2_glibc26_2.zip
./MCMA2_Linux_x86_64 -setpass PASSWORD -configonly
Replace PASSWORD with the password of your choice.

Run the server like this:
./MCMA2_Linux_x86_64

Always log in as <MINECRAFT_USERNAME> and go to /home/<MINECRAFT_USERNAME>/minecraft-server/McMyAdmin/ and run ./MCMA2_Linux_x86_64 to fire up your server.
Then, open your browser and go to http://localhost:8080 and log in with your McMyAdmin username and password, and configure your server! Default username is admin.

In case you messed something up, and you want to start over, simply delete the newly created user and all it's files. Like this: 
sudo userdel -f -r <MINECRAFT_USERNAME>
